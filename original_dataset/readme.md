## Data Description

In the MAOSTE project, the dataset is organized into three main files:

- `train.txt`: This file contains the training dataset, which is used to train the MAOSTE model.

- `dev.txt`: The development dataset, or validation dataset.

- `test.txt`: This file consists of the test dataset used for evaluating the performance of the trained MAOSTE model.

### Image Data

Corresponding images for the dataset are not directly included but can be obtained based on the `IMGID` from sources such as Twitter15, Twitter17, and Twitter-GMNER. These images play a crucial role in the multimodal aspect of the analysis.

### Future Data Release

We plan to release the processed version of this dataset in the future to facilitate further research and development in the field of multimodal sentiment analysis.

Further instructions on preprocessing the data and integrating images will be provided upon the release of the processed datasets.
